I am glad that I am born in my family.. i love them very much.  i am grateful for them for eternity. they are very caring and kind. they always make me a priority.

So this is all roots from the problem of my weight. I'm underweight for my age. its because i have high metabolism . for me weight gain is very very difficult. there are many many times i tried but as of no results i would give up. even now I'm not meeting my ideal type of weight.

This even though I'm sad about it , I don't want it to drag me down so i want to like try to forgot about it and live a tension free life. but here the problem is my dad....

My dad is a chill guy usually. he doesn't stress about anything much. even though i have many health problems he never said anything to me. and he always wants the best for me i know that . but my dad is so so so soooo much on about how healthy i am. he will always think like 'my daughter is soo thin she fill definitely face problems in the future. how will she marry and give birth to a child???'- things like that. and its fine if he has that worry and its reasonable too but he ALWAYSSSS talks about it like ALWAYS. whenever he is home he will be like;

 "why are u soo thin?? "

"why is my daughter so weak ??"

"you are removing my honour . how can i even say you as my daughter to other people??"

"when will you become fat??"

"why are you like this. how can you be my daughter ,so thin and powerless"

etc.. therse are the most common phrases that he uses aside from them he will call me nicknames right? so usually the nickname itself is sweet but he always adds "thin" in front of that nickname.....ugh sometimes i feel so nauseated hearing those names fron him.

there are also these kinds of phrases which he use which seem positive but imply a different hidden meaning;

"i like big fat babies in the future" (implying i should give birth to a healthy baby)

"i like it if you will have cheeks"

he would be saying these kind of phrases so many times . so soooo many times whenever he sees me or he is in the house ...its suffocating sometimes, my day be going normally and then he like brings up all the fkin worries and insecurities i have to my face in just one word. he literally says these so often that its like frequency of hearing a "amen" in Christianity.

ughh ...really its so so soo tiring, frustrating, sad at many times. it makes me so so angry at times but i cant say anything to my parents cause i respect them. but how does he not even understand that like why should i always bring up this insecurity. he doesn't even understand how i feel. like literally i don't understand how does he think insulting me will fix problems?? maybe he likes think its a reverse psychology and i will change for the better but that's IMPOSSIBLE. 

sigh... I'm really exhausted and at my limit so i poured my heart here. i don't know how should i even deal with this?? for now as i dont want to upset myself so i like go into my room without talking anything cause its best to ignore him. all these things make me feel like maybe i need to be independent from family. Ofc I'm really grateful but this difference in views is often suffocating.
