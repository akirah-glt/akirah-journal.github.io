yesterday i was told to give a presentation by our HoD my college and it was so frustrating for me. 

this all started the previous week when the hod asked in class he wanted two people to give a presentation on a topic and as no one volunteered he asked "who got the highest marks in last Sem" and i had to stand up (unfortunately..) and he said then you are going to give the presentation . i had no choice but to agree when being pointed out. to be honest that was the least thing i wanted to do but still it will help improve my skills i thought so i agreed. 

i had 1 week to prepare and the hod said that he would help with the explanation and clarify my doubts so he invited me to his cabin. my friend also came with me and we both split the concept to explain in the class . it was all fine but the thing was that the concept is difficult to make people understand.

on the weekend i tried to make a good presentation as possible but then no matter how much i tried i couldnt get it. i couldnt sleep. i couldn't eat properly too. so the next day came and last period i had to give the presentation ...i had to.. so i kinda pulled it off with the learning and then after lunch i was hit with a severe headache . it was so so severe that i felt like i had been shot in the head. i wanted it to be over as soon as possible.

but that didnt happen , the hod came and he litrally gave the introduction for 30 fkin minutes . LIKE HE ALREADY TOLD THE 90 PERCENT CONTENT . what was even there to explain. better he just say everything and leave i thought.

i also had this hidden pressure from our classmates that i would give a good presentation all the time and that was so SUFFOCATING.

i really REALLYY didn't give a shit on what they think about me...at least i don't want to. and yet here i was caring about what they will think unconsciously. at this point i was beyond exhausted. i had headache ,fear about performance and their opinions. and i was also frustrated at myself for thinking that.

then they called my name. the hod sat in the class itself listening. i started the presentation of the complecated topic. everyone was silent and it was going well and i was doing my best not to mess up and make them understand. then the hod stood up and he walked out of the room (cause it was almost time to go home). the class became noisy and i could tell that many of them were not listening.this made me nervous and i finished the presentaion as soon as possible. 

then when i got of the stage they all clapped. 

but i was feeling so damn empty inside , it was like i was alone in this world would understand my pain. it was so frustrating when even having this much of headache i had to give a worthless presentation which no one probably understood cause it was complicated and the fact that the hod just left in the middle and that i prepared hard ...for what? those people?

i really really know that its not like we can control everyone's attention .. i know...but still ... it was so frustrating...

then i had vomiting due to the severe headache while i was boarding the bus. i couldn't even sleep in the bus due to pain. while walking home i couldn't even walk straight cause it was so painful. SO MUCH PAIN. it lasted all night i didn't eat . I just slept like i was in a coma. i couldn't feel anything.... times like these makes me wonder

"its such a pain to be born here. why must i suffer?"
